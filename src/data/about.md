# Hello World

### My name is Jacob Morris, also known by my online tag Govern01 or Gove.

I am a 20 something year old software developer and game designer/developer, filled with many aspirations and ideas especially for creating games and unique experiences. With my designs, I aim to challenge established design principles in order to subvert viewer/player expectations and catch them off guard, through doing this I believe a simple experience can become much more memorable.  
This fuels my raison d'Ãªtre; a well designed game can provide a window into the players soul and with that power the narrative can impart unforgettable concepts and philosophy. As a final addition to my game design rant, I believe that the more niche details a game can bring in the more attention it will generate.  
As a person I'm pretty addicted to robots (especially highly mechanical designs) and swords, and I will find any way to shoehorn them in a project.  
I spend every waking moment listening to music and have an incredibly diverse taste, from indie rock to hardcore EDM I always have something (I mean I'm listening to The Blade Chose Me by Rainboydragoneyes as I write this).  
Contributing to my mechanical adoration, I spend a lot of time learning new maths topics and try to understand the underlying maths of what I am using even if it's not required (one day I'll understand quaternions). Regarding the games I play I tend to focus on roguelikes and anything moddable.
